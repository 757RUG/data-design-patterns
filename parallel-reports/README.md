Parallel reports
================

Problems
--------

1. Interactive development of reports is hard to do right, in a way that encourages you to write the best code with the greatest payoffs down the road.
2. There will always be more code than room on the final report or presentation.
3. It's hard to reuse code used for literate documentation.
